					<p>Summaries of a Few Coding Projects:</p>

					<h3>A Daring Escape Challenge Problem</h3>
					<p>Class: Data Structures</p>
					<p>This problem was to answer the question of how many moves can a knight make on and
					infinite chessboard before it cannot make anymore moves. The board is set up as a spiral 
					of growing numbers and the knight always moves to the lowest number in its range, and it cannot 
					visit the same square twice. I wrote an algorithm that created the chess board and simulated 
					the knight moving through it.<br></p>

					<h3>Huffman Encoding Challenge Problem</h3>
					<p>Class: Algorithm Design and Analysis</p>
					<p>This problem was to create two versions of the Huffman Encoder algorithm, one 
					that encodes individual letters and one that encodes letter pairs, based on which are most common, 
					and compare the two methods based on the size of output. I had to code both 
					algorithms and then determine which one was more space efficient in its output.</p>
